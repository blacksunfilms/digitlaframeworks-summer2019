<h2>DIGITAL FRAMEWORKS: ASSIGNMENT ONE</h2>
<b>Matt Reynolds -- July 2019</b>

<h3>DATA STORY PITCHES</h3>

1. *LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH* 

What are the leading causes of death in the United States and how does the D.C. area compare with other regions? The focus of my data story will be on suicide rates. 

Using the most recent data set at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I will look at the rate of suicides per capita in each state. Through my reporting, I will examine why certain states have higher suicide rates than others. 

I will combine a text story with bar charts and a map. I will limit my findings to the ten states with the highest suicide rates, and interview experts and stakeholders in those states to back up my data analysis. 

2. *DC CRIME DATA* 

I will examine D.C. crime data to reveal the most prevalent crimes in the district for 2018. Specifically, I will interrogate the data to pinpoint where the most violent crimes are. 

This information is important to audiences who want a better idea of the neighborhoods that are the safest or most dangerous. Through the data, I might also reveal police bias and question why authorities have a  heightened presence in particular neighborhoods.

I will write a text feature with accompanying charts and a geocoded map. I will visit  neighborhoods and interview residents and also contact the police department, other local stakeholders, and experts. 

<h3>CRITIQUE</h3> 

"Anti-LGBT hate crimes are rising, the FBI says. But it gets worse," June 2019 [USA TODAY] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/anti-gay-hate-crimes-rise-fbi-says-and-they-likely-undercount/1582614001/)

1. *Objective: Clarity and accuracy*

Four out of five.  It was clear to me that this story was about increases in hate crimes against the LGBT community though it might have been helpful to signal early on that such crimes might have been unreported because of flaws in the data. The headline also made clear what to expect.

2. *Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data?*

Four out of five. The presentation of the FBI data was straightforward, using line graphs and bar charts. This simple approach complemented the story. The bars and charts were not a distraction and it was easy to navigate the page. There might have been a way to make the charts more interactive, or expand on the data by creating an interactive map that shows where the most hate crimes happen.

3. *Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate?*

Three out of five. The reporter was transparent in pointing out the flaws in the data and concerns that hate crimes may be underreported even though more agencies say they are reporting. The journalist noted that some crimes were omitted from the data, and emphasized that local and state law enforcement agencies do not need to report hate crimes. The percentage of agencies reporting hate crime has declined. The reporter does not just rely on the data, she also spoke to several other sources, including a former Attorney General.

The story may have benefited from more sources of data from cities and states. 

4. *Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality?* 

Three out of five. The graphics are unfussy and well executed but it might have been effective to include more interactive elements such as a geocoded map, or even make the line and bar graphics more interactive. Sometimes, however, a simple approach is best and because this is a print-based article, the graphics do a solid job of communicating the findings in the article in an unfussy and unobtrusive way. I like the graphic that presents the gap between federal and self-reported hate crimes. It was simple but effective. I also like the map that shows where the states stand on hate crimes, though it was another opportunity to include interactive elements (perhaps a count of how many hate crimes had been reported in each state).

5. *Type and color*

Type: Three out of five. The typography felt uninspired. The graphics do not exactly pop out at the reader. But perhaps that was the intention. I like the use of speech bubbles to pinpoint statistics. 

Color: Two out of five. I wasn't sure about the choice of red and grey. Even two colors might have made the graphics pop more (say red and blue).

6. *Creativity*

Three out of five. The keep-it-simple approach works well for this print story. Though there was a feeling that even small flourishes and interactive elements could have made this story stand out more.
