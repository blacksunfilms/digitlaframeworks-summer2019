<h2>DIGITAL FRAMEWORKS: ASSIGNMENT TWO</h2>
<b>Matt Reynolds -- July 2019</b>

<p>1)	Description of the question you're curious about.

I’m interested in how much time each member of congress will spend in toss up districts in 2020. I will focus on politicians who are in swing districts, and perhaps limit the datasets to one or two battleground states.  

2)	The list of things you want to know

How many town halls did they hold in their district? I would also look at congressional reports to uncover the data I need. I would study local media reports and also look back at or request congressional members’ calendars, and look at the press releases posted at their websites, and their congressional reports.

Days in Washington.  I would rely on roll calls and other congressional data to uncover this. I would also phone each office to confirm and verify this information. 

How much time did each member spend on vacation? I would rely on local media reports, as congress members calendars. Again, I would call each member of congress. 

The status of their seat and the result of the last election. I will first establish which seats are swing districts by looking at media reports. I would then go to the election boards in those states to confirm the status of each seat.</p>
