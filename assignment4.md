<h1>DIGITAL FRAMEWORKS: ASSIGNMENT FOUR</h1>

**Matt Reynolds -- July 2019**

I will analyze DC crime data to reveal murder rates in the city from 2013 to 2018 and look at the neighborhoods that have seen increases or decreases. I will interview city officials, as well as stakeholders in the community with the highest murder rates.  

Through analysis and reporting I will answer why homicide rates have gone down in certain areas but gone up in others. Through the data, I might also reveal police bias and question why authorities have a heightened presence in particular neighborhoods.  Murder rates are always of interest to readers but I will try to make the story timely by tying it to recent news stories and 2019 homicide data.  

I will need to join separate data sets. I will make a geocoded map that pinpoints each reported homicide. I will also create a bar chart that compares murder rates from 2013 to 2018.
